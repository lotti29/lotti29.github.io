In my previous post I spoke about wanting to cultivate a habit of daily tracking. Another habit I want to try and get into is improving my reading and writing skills. During my undergrad I had to write multiple essays a week, which, while pretty tiring, did keep these skills sharp. Recently I've found that while my curiosity about psychology and behavioural science hasn't changed, my ability to articulate my thoughts about it has diminished somewhat. Hopefully this blog can change that!

Every now and then I'll make a post detailing what I've been reading or working on. My intention is to move from passively consuming information to actively engaging with it. 

Without further ado, here's three articles that have piqued my interest this week:

### Happy Git with R

After changing computers and carefully porting my projects over, I realised it was probably time I figure out how to use Git and GitHub properly. I am using it to an extent already for this website, but so far I've only used narrow tutorials specific only to the problem at hand. No, if I want to have easy access to my projects across systems (and have accessible) I have to wrangle with the infamous Git. 

Fortunately, [Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/) has made this process much smoother. It's written informally and with plenty of contingencies ~~if~~ *when* something goes wrong. Most importantly, it's written for R users, and assumes no wider computing knowledge outside of that. Often when figuring out a coding problem I end up going down rabbit holes far outside my comfort zone, so it's nice to have a straightforward tutorial designed around someone with my background. 

Now, I feel I have a good knowledge bedrock to build upon. For example, I plan to use this skill to implement [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) into my R projects. Hooray reproducibility!
