This is a collection of useful websites I've found. I will continuously update it with additional content as I find more. If you have any suggestions for the list, let me know on LinkedIn!

#### Psychology Websites
**[Behavioural Scientist.org](https://behavioralscientist.org/)** - A handy meta-resource for a wide range of behavioural science topics. Not only are its articles cutting edge and well-researched, it is very well organised, allowing you to dive straight into the behavioural science of a particular topic. I also plan to explore its ![Writing Resources](https://behavioralscientist.org/writing-resources/) page to give my own writing a bit of polish.

**[Human Factors 101](https://humanfactors101.com/)** - As the daughter of a chemical engineer, I've been fascinated by human factors for a long time, but so far my reading on the topic has mainly been through an engineering lens. Martin Anderson's website has let me explore the topic more directly from an human factors expert. He explores the topic over a huge range of contexts, and is adept at finding applicable lessons in any case study, no matter the field. For example, I have recently enjoyed his article ![Nimrod XV230: Parallels with healthcare](https://humanfactors101.com/2016/07/24/nimrod-healthcare/), which manages to show what hospitals can learn from a military engineering disaster. 

**[Growth Design](https://growth.design/)** - Formerly Dark Patterns, I first learnt about Growth Design on a behavioural science consulting course. Its interactive presentation and use of real-world case studies makes it an engaging resource for revising applications of behavioural science. It is certainly a more business focused website rather than an academic one, but it is nonetheless a really useful way to learn how behavioural science is used (and misused) in daily life.

**[AEON](https://aeon.co/)** - I came to this website as a recommendation from Behavioural Scientist. It should have come with a warning, as I spent more than an hour reading its incredibly in-depth articles! Although not all of the topics it covers are psychology related, I would still recommend it for an intellectual diversion. It is also one of the few websites that I feel tackles philosophical topics effectively, without sensationalising. 

**[Tim Harford](https://timharford.com/article/)** My favourite popular science writer, Tim Harford's blog is the main inspiration for this website. Though he is primarily an economist, he also uses insights from behavioural science and human factors to inform his writing. Tim often uses real-life scenarios to provide a grounded backdrop to his articles, such as in his podcast ![Cautionary Tales](https://open.spotify.com/show/2yPlb6ynbhTJbziSIcykQd). He will often discuss wildly different topics within the same episode, such as the La La Land Oscar fiasco and Galileo, leaving you to wonder how they could possibly be related. Yet, by the end, he manages to draw insightful connections between these once-disparate themes, coming to useful conclusions applicable in everyday life. What I particuarly enjoy about his articles is how evidence-based they are: he draws insightful stories out of the data, rather than trying to force the data to fit his stories. His articles have inspired a few future blog posts that I hope to make soon.

#### Coding and Data Science Resources

**[Understanding Github](https://readwrite.com/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)** This blog requires use of git to function, and dealing with github as a new user was rather daunting. I found this article to be a great introduction to the platform and a useful reference when troubleshooting. I hope to use github for some future projects.

**[R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)** - This free online course was the perfect introduction to R in undergrad, covering the full data science pipeline from tidying to visualising. 

**[Andy Kirk](https://visualisingdata.com/posts/)** - Andy Kirk's Handbook of Data Visualisation is a wonderful tool for inspiring new visualisation projects, and his blog is just as insightful. He has a particular focus on the design elements of visualisation that can add to or detract from the visualisation. His [post](https://visualisingdata.com/2015/01/make-grey-best-friend/) on colour (or rather, lack of it) is a great starting point.
