title: Useful Psychology Resources (Beta)
subtitle: A collection of handy pages and websites I've found (will be updated continuously)

This post is just about the things I'm reading or using at the moment that I've found useful. It will be updated continuously as I discover more things. This post will also be a handy way to practice building easy-to-read lists in Markdown. 

After leaving Uni I've feel my writing skills have weakened somewhat, so I've decided to get into the habit of writing short summaries of what I've been reading, even if it's just a few sentences. I'm hoping this blog will help motivate me to keep the habit up. I might even be motivated to post my own thoughts on behavioural science at some point - who knows! 


Cool Psychology Websites
![Behavioural Scientist.org](https://behavioralscientist.org/) - A handy meta-resource for a wide range of behavioural science topics. Not only are its articles cutting edge and well-researched, it is really well organised, allowing you to dive straight into the behavioural science of a particular topic. I definitely plan to explore its ![Writing Resources](https://behavioralscientist.org/writing-resources/) page to give my own writing a bit of polish.

![Human Factors 101](https://humanfactors101.com/) - As the daughter of a chemical engineer, I've been fascinated by human factors for a long time, but so far my reading on the topic has mainly been through an engineering lens. Martin Anderson's website has let me explore the topic more directly, putting HF right in the centre of discussion. He explores the implementation of human factors (both good and bad) in a huge variety of contexts, and he is an expert at taking lessons from one scenario and applying them to another. For example, I have recently enjoyed his article ![Nimrod XV230: Parallels with healthcare](https://humanfactors101.com/2016/07/24/nimrod-healthcare/), which manages to show what hospitals can learn from a military engineering disaster. 

![Growth Design](https://growth.design/) Formerly Dark Patterns, I first learnt about Growth Design on a behavioural science consulting course. (TBC)
