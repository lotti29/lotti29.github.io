This is a collection of books and websites that I've found interesting, and I'll update this page as time goes on. This post will also be a handy way to practice building easy-to-read lists in Markdown. 

After leaving Uni I've feel my writing skills have weakened somewhat, so I've decided to get into the habit of writing short summaries of what I've been reading, even if it's just a few sentences. In the future, I might also write longer book reviews of new releases in behavioural science.


#### Psychology Websites
**[Behavioural Scientist.org](https://behavioralscientist.org/)** - A handy meta-resource for a wide range of behavioural science topics. Not only are its articles cutting edge and well-researched, it is very well organised, allowing you to dive straight into the behavioural science of a particular topic. I also plan to explore its ![Writing Resources](https://behavioralscientist.org/writing-resources/) page to give my own writing a bit of polish.

**[Human Factors 101](https://humanfactors101.com/)** - As the daughter of a chemical engineer, I've been fascinated by human factors for a long time, but so far my reading on the topic has mainly been through an engineering lens. Martin Anderson's website has let me explore the topic more directly from an human factors expert. He explores the topic over a huge range of contexts, and is adept at finding applicable lessons in any case study, no matter the field. For example, I have recently enjoyed his article ![Nimrod XV230: Parallels with healthcare](https://humanfactors101.com/2016/07/24/nimrod-healthcare/), which manages to show what hospitals can learn from a military engineering disaster. 

**[Growth Design](https://growth.design/)** - Formerly Dark Patterns, I first learnt about Growth Design on a behavioural science consulting course. Its interactive presentation and use of real-world case studies makes it an engaging resource for revising applications of behavioural science. It is certainly a more business focused website rather than an academic one, but it is nonetheless a really useful way to learn how behavioural science is used (and misused) in daily life.

**[Tim Harford](https://timharford.com/article/)** My favourite popular science writer, Tim Harford's blog is the inspiration for this website. Though he is primarily an economist, he also uses insights from behavioural science and human factors to inform his writing. Tim often uses real-life scenarios to provide a grounded backdrop to his articles, such as in his podcast ![Cautionary Tales](https://open.spotify.com/show/2yPlb6ynbhTJbziSIcykQd). He will often discuss wildly different topics within the same episode, such as the La La Land Oscar fiasco and Galileo, leaving you to wonder how they could possibly be related. Yet, by the end, he manages to draw insightful connections between these once-disparate themes, coming to useful conclusions applicable in everyday life. What I particuarly enjoy about his articles is how evidence-based they are: he draws insightful stories out of the data, rather than trying to force the data to fit his stories. His articles have inspired a few future blog posts that I hope to make soon.

#### Books 

**Misbehaving** - Richard Thaler - My starting point for behavioural science. Misbehaving was recommended to me over Thinking, Fast and Slow, and while I love the latter I am very glad I didn't read it first! Thaler's perspective as an economist and academic is invaluable for someone interested in using behavioural insights in the real world. You do not need a strong foundation in economics or psychology to make sense of the book, as he explains the fundamentals of each in a way that is clear without being overly detailed. In addition, by framing his book as a semi-autobiography, you obtain a chronological view of the development of behavioural economics and the challenges the discipline has faced along the way. 

**Thinking, Fast and Slow** - *Daniel Kahneman* - Where it all actually started! At least, when behavioural science came into mainstream view. When I finally read the book, I was quite surprised by its popularity, as although it is a fascinating and well-written book it is also very academic and thorough. In many ways it is the bible of behavioural science: foundational, dense and occasionally outdated, but still extremely influential. An overview of TFAS's issues with evidence can be found ![here](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/20/placed-much-faith-underpowered-studies-nobel-prize-winner-admits-mistakes/) - it is worth noting that it was published in 2011, right before the replication crisis in psychology precipitated. Although I currently am not confident enough in my statistical ability to critically examine the report, Kahneman's comments on his own work illustrate the book's issues plainly. 
Though the specifics of some of the evidence cited in the book may be shaky, I think the book is still groundbreaking for producing many of the theories behavioural science uses today, such as bounded rationality and loss aversion (the latter of which I have since helped replicate in a global experiment - so there's definitely some evidence for that!)

The next two books were on Behavioural Scientist's Books to Watch list. 

**Thinking 101** - *Prof Woo-Kyoung Ahn* - In many ways this is a condensation of the insights from the books above, converted into a self-help book. While most of the core principles in the book will be familiar to behavioural scientists, the straightforward presentation of the book and mixture of anecdotal stories and real-world studies is refreshing. I can see myself recommending this book over *Misbehaving* as an introduction to behavioural science.  As someone who will be job-seeking after graduation, I particularly enjoyed her perspectives on the hiring process.

**Don't Trust Your Gut** - *Seth Stephens-Davidowitz* - Another twist on the self-help genre, this book uses Big Data studies to help the reader make better choices in life. The book is broken down into different chapters based on what the reader is trying to improve, such as dating prospects, job hunting or just general happiness. My agreement with the author's conclusions greatly varied depending on the method of inference used.

#### Coding Resources

**[Understanding Github](https://readwrite.com/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)** This blog requires use of git to function, and dealing with github as a new user was rather daunting. I found this article to be a great introduction to the platform and a useful reference when troubleshooting. I hope to use github for some future projects.

**[R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)** - This free online course was the perfect introduction to R in undergrad, covering the full data science pipeline from tidying to visualising.
