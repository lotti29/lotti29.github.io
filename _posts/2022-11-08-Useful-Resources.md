Here are the books that have shaped my interest in behavioural science and psychology. I'd recommend

After leaving Uni I've feel my writing skills have weakened somewhat, so I've decided to get into the habit of writing short summaries of what I've been reading, even if it's just a few sentences. In the future, I might also write longer book reviews of new releases in behavioural science.


#### Psychology Books

**Misbehaving** - Richard Thaler - My starting point for behavioural science. Misbehaving was recommended to me over Thinking, Fast and Slow, and while I love the latter I am very glad I didn't read it first! Thaler's perspective as an economist and academic is invaluable for someone interested in using behavioural insights in the real world. You do not need a strong foundation in economics or psychology to make sense of the book, as he explains the fundamentals of each in a way that is clear without being overly detailed. In addition, by framing his book as a semi-autobiography, you obtain a chronological view of the development of behavioural economics and the challenges the discipline has faced along the way. 

**Thinking, Fast and Slow** - *Daniel Kahneman* - Where it all actually started! At least, when behavioural science came into mainstream view. When I finally read the book, I was quite surprised by its popularity, as although it is a fascinating and well-written book it is also very academic and thorough. In many ways it is the bible of behavioural science: foundational, dense and occasionally outdated, but still extremely influential. An overview of TFAS's issues with evidence can be found ![here](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/20/placed-much-faith-underpowered-studies-nobel-prize-winner-admits-mistakes/) - it is worth noting that it was published in 2011, right before the replication crisis in psychology precipitated. Although I currently am not confident enough in my statistical ability to critically examine the report, Kahneman's comments on his own work illustrate the book's issues plainly. 
Though the specifics of some of the evidence cited in the book may be shaky, I think the book is still groundbreaking for producing many of the theories behavioural science uses today, such as bounded rationality and loss aversion (the latter of which I have since helped replicate in a global experiment - so there's definitely some evidence for that!)


The next two books were on Behavioural Scientist's Books to Watch list.

**Thinking 101** - *Prof Woo-Kyoung Ahn* - In many ways this is a condensation of the insights from the books above, converted into a self-help book. While most of the core principles in the book will be familiar to behavioural scientists, the straightforward presentation of the book and mixture of anecdotal stories and real-world studies is refreshing. I can see myself recommending this book over *Misbehaving* as an introduction to behavioural science.  As someone who will be job-seeking after graduation, I particularly enjoyed her perspectives on the hiring process.

**Don't Trust Your Gut** - *Seth Stephens-Davidowitz* - Another twist on the self-help genre, this book uses Big Data studies to help the reader make better choices in life. The book is broken down into different chapters based on what the reader is trying to improve, such as dating prospects, job hunting or just general happiness. There are some case studies in here I plan to discuss more thoroughly on my blog in the future. Stephens-Davidowitz has particularly inspired me to consider ways I could use data from my own life to improve my decison making, particularly in the realm of health.
