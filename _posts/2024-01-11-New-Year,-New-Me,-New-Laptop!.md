Finally, I've managed to get VSCode and the website's repository running properly on my new laptop (or at least that will be true if this post is visible on the blog!) I can now improve my data science skills with fewer hurdles - for example, I don't have to delete old applications to make room for memory when I want to try something new.  

I don't have any concrete new years resolutions this time round, at least not ones with a strictly defined success/failure state. There are some habits that I want to try to cultivate this year however, and skills I want to improve. In particular, I'd like to improve my health and increase my data handling ability. As such, I've found a new project that could handle both of these at once!

Recently, I've noticed a huge surge in people tracking their personal data. If you browse r/dataisbeautiful around the new year, you will find scores of people posting personal data they have tracked over the course of the year. Usually this appears to be with the goal of self-improvement, such as tracking daily mood or alcohol consumption. There have been so many such posts recently that the moderators have restricted personal data posts to Mondays only.

The volume of these posts can indeed get a little exhausting (I think I can wait a while before seeing another recruitment Sankey diagram) but I understand why they are so popular: data science is a lot more fun when the data is relevant to you! It's definitely a tad narcissitic, but I think I would get much more out of visualising my mood over the course of a year than messing around with the mtcars package for the fiftieth time. In addition, I'm very curious to see what patterns might appear. I have a couple of health issues that can be affected by things such as diet and sleep. 

As such, I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I've created a dataframe in R that has columns for the variables I want to keep track of - such as hours of sleep, mood, 5-a-day. It also has a column for a string where I can I can update it daily. I think after a month of data collection I should be able to generate some insights, but I'm aware there's a lot more I need to learn first.

At the end of the day, I won't be taking this tracking too seriously. It's incredibly difficult to get research participants to track accurate data about themselves, and I'm definitely no exception. It probably won't be possible to generate actionable insights from such subjective data collection. However, if this experiment falls victim to the ![Hawthorne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect), I don't think that would be a bad thing! 

I also hope this data collection will encourage me to try new methods of model generation and data visualisation. Even if I can't generate any new insights from this data, I hope I'll be able to make some pretty graphs and learn more about linear models. 

Stay tuned!
